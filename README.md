# [The Pac-Man Projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html)

## Overview
The Pac-Man projects were developed for UC Berkeley's introductory artificial intelligence course, CS 188. They apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man. However, these projects don't focus on building AI for video games. Instead, they teach foundational AI concepts, such as informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning. These concepts underly real-world application areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.

We designed these projects with three goals in mind. The projects allow students to visualize the results of the techniques they implement. They also contain code examples and clear directions, but do not force students to wade through undue amounts of scaffolding. Finally, Pac-Man provides a challenging problem environment that demands creative solutions; real-world AI problems are challenging, and Pac-Man is too.

## Projects Overview

### [UNIX/Python Tutorial](https://ai.berkeley.edu/tutorial.html)
This short UNIX/Python tutorial introduces students to the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language and the UNIX environment.

### [Search](https://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html)
Students implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

### [Multi-Agent Search](https://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html)
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Students implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

### [Reinforcement Learning](https://ai.berkeley.edu/reinforcement.html)
Students implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbook's Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

### [Ghostbusters](https://ai.berkeley.edu/tracking.html)
Probabilistic inference in a hidden Markov model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Students implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

### [Classification](https://ai.berkeley.edu/classification.html)
Students implement standard machine learning classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, Perceptron, and MIRA models to classify digits. Students extend this by implementing a behavioral cloning Pacman agent.

### [Contest: Pacman Capture the Flag](https://ai.berkeley.edu/contest.html)
Students create strategies for a team of two agents to play a multi-player capture-the-flag variant of Pacman.

## Technical Notes
The Pac-Man projects are written in pure Python 2.7 and do not depend on any packages external to a standard Python distribution.
